# Degree-verification-system-using-blockchain
Our proposed model follows the same decentralized system. The institution will upload the certificate of the students on the blockchain and we have made use of Pinata. Pinata is a cloud based storage platform that stores the file uploaded by the institution. After that with the help of smart-contracts that will maintain the ledger that is the institutions will share the certificates to the students with their unique 16-bits address. And the students who have registered with the institution and completed the course will be provided the access of the certificates. This will be done with the help of Metamask that is the user will be authenticated and the transaction will be carried out. Onthe students side they will be able to view the certifications on their side when they will give the input of 16-bit unique address of the organizations or institutions issuing the certificate and thereafter they will be able to view the certificates if they have been given the access. The company hiring the candidates which require to verify if the candidates certification’s provided are legitimate or not can cross verify the certificates address with the address of the organization issuing it if they match it means the certifications are legit. This will overall increase the transparency and reduce the fraudulent activities.
